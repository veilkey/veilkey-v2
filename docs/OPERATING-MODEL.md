# VeilKey Operating Model

This document explains the shortest operator-facing model of VeilKey.

Canonical home: `https://veil-key.com`

## Core Split

- `KeyCenter`
  - central control plane
  - registration, policy, audit, bulk changes
- `LocalVault`
  - node-local runtime
  - ciphertext/context storage
  - heartbeat, rebind, rotation
  - execution boundary close to the workload
- `proxy`
  - outbound enforcement layer when runtime traffic should be mediated

## End-To-End Shape

```text
operator / CLI
      |
      v
  KeyCenter
      |
      +---- LocalVault (container A)
      +---- LocalVault (container B)
      +---- LocalVault (host node)
```

The practical meaning is:

1. operators act on the central control plane
2. KeyCenter records policy and desired runtime state
3. LocalVault nodes heartbeat and reconcile toward that state
4. wrapped execution stays close to the node instead of moving runtime secrets into a hosted SaaS edge

## Typical Operator Flow

1. install or activate a LocalVault node
2. verify `KeyCenter` and `LocalVault` health
3. unlock or initialize KeyCenter
4. register and inspect node identity
5. apply rotation or rebind from the center
6. verify heartbeat and updated runtime state

## What Success Looks Like

- KeyCenter health responds
- LocalVault health responds
- the node reports heartbeat
- runtime state reflects the current `key_version`
- rebind and rotation are explicit, not silent drift

## Why This Matters

The point of this split is not just secret storage.

It gives you:

- central visibility
- node-local runtime enforcement
- explicit execution boundaries
- controlled rollout and bulk updates across multiple nodes
