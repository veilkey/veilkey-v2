# VeilKey KeyCenter

`keycenter` is the central self-hosted VeilKey control plane.

It tracks LocalVault inventory, policy, lifecycle, and orchestration state. It is not a generic plaintext secret bucket.

## Product Position

VeilKey is split into:

- `managed`
  - `veilkey-docs`
  - `veilkey-homepage`
- `self-hosted`
  - `installer`
  - `keycenter`
  - `localvault`
  - `cli`
  - `proxy`

## Responsibilities

This component owns:

- LocalVault inventory
- runtime identity tracking
- policy and lifecycle decisions
- orchestration endpoints
- central UI and control-plane APIs

KeyCenter is specifically responsible for:

- Tracking the actual `scope` / `status` of each LocalVault secret storage response
- Returning `VK:TEMP:*` / `status=temp` for new secret creation by default, while preserving existing lifecycle on active secret updates
- Exposing LocalVault secret query/list responses using scoped token contracts (`VK:{SCOPE}:{REF}`)
- Maintaining scoped canonical `VE:{SCOPE}:{KEY}` contracts for LocalVault config save/query/list responses
- Treating `localvault` strictly as a ciphertext store
- Managing LocalVault inventory by `vault_name:vault_hash` and `key_version`
- Managing `managed_paths` sent by each LocalVault in its heartbeat as inventory metadata
- Using `vault_node_uuid` (compatibility alias: `node_id`) / `vault_hash` as the actual ownership identifiers; `managed_paths` is a descriptive path list only
- Mirroring LocalVault lifecycle transitions via tracked ref sync; direct `VK:LOCAL:*` resolve uses this tracked ref state
- Escalating a LocalVault to `rebind_required` on key version mismatch or suspected reset, then transitioning to `blocked` on repeated reconnection
- Scheduling planned rotation via `POST /api/agents/rotate-all`, which LocalVault cron ticks apply automatically
- Escalating `rotation_required` LocalVaults through `1min -> 3min -> 10min` stages, then marking them `blocked` / `rotation_timeout` and auto-excluding them from the next planned rotation
- Central policy, encryption/decryption, and tracking; plaintext handling and lifecycle decisions are driven by upstream operator boundaries
- Not providing direct `/api/secrets*` plaintext CRUD
- Enforcing `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$` naming for new secret/config names

## Why KeyCenter Exists

KeyCenter solves the following problems:

- In environments with many similar services, local secret contexts bleed into each other
- Old LocalVault identities can reattach and reopen stale secret contexts
- TEMP / LOCAL / EXTERNAL lifecycle must be tracked centrally
- Operational policies like planned rotation, rebind, and block are impractical to maintain independently on each local node

Even though each LocalVault holds its own secrets, KeyCenter decides "who is who", "what state they are in", and "whether re-registration is allowed".

## Identity Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|

           +-- local secret/config API   +-- resolve via parent
           +-- heartbeat -> root
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `veilkey-keycenter` | Start server (after init) |
| `veilkey-keycenter init --root` | Initialize root node |
| `veilkey-keycenter init --child` | Initialize child/localvault node (auto-registers with parent) |

> Platform-specific integration (LXC env sync, etc.) is managed alongside veilroot boundary assets in `cli`.

## API

### Secrets / Agent Plaintext Flow

KeyCenter is not a central plaintext secret store.
Plaintext input is accepted only from hostvault or explicit agent routes; direct `/api/secrets*` CRUD is not supported.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST /api/agents/{agent}/secrets` | `{"name":"key","value":"val"}` | Store hostvault/plaintext input; returns canonical `token`, `scope`, `status`, and vault metadata |
| `GET /api/agents/{agent}/secrets` | | List secret inventory based on LocalVault metadata |
| `GET /api/agents/{agent}/secrets/{name}` | | Retrieve plaintext by vault hash |
| `GET /api/resolve-agent/{token}` | | Direct resolve by vault hash + ref token (internal/ops use) |
| `GET /api/resolve/{ref}` | | Resolve tracked ref / vault storage path |
| `POST /api/agents/rotate-all` | `{}` | Schedule planned rotation for eligible LocalVaults, incrementing `key_version` by 1 |

Ownership boundaries:

- **Operator boundary**: plaintext input and host operational context
- **LocalVault**: per-node ciphertext storage and actual secret/config API
- **KeyCenter**: central policy, tracked refs, inventory, lifecycle, decrypt/resolve orchestration

`name` and `key` accept uppercase identifiers only:
- Allowed: `GITLAB_PAT_PUBLIC`, `VEILKEY_KEYCENTER_URL`
- Rejected: `gitlab_pat`, `Bad_Key`, `BAD@KEY`

### Node Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/node-info` | | Current HKM node info (includes `tracked_refs_count`) |
| `GET /api/children` | | List registered child nodes |
| `POST /api/register` | | Register child node (called automatically by `init --child`) |
| `DELETE /api/children/{node_id}` | | Delete child node (`vault_node_uuid` path alias) |
| `DELETE /api/agents/by-node/{node_id}` | | Deregister LocalVault agent; the installer purge calls this route before removing the host LocalVault to clean up inventory |
| `GET /api/configs` | | List VE (configs) held by self/all-in-one LocalVault |
| `GET /api/configs/{key}` | | Retrieve individual VE (config) from self/all-in-one LocalVault |
| `POST /api/configs` | | Store VE (config) in self/all-in-one LocalVault |
| `PUT /api/configs/bulk` | | Bulk store VE (configs) in self/all-in-one LocalVault |
| `DELETE /api/configs/{key}` | | Delete VE (config) from self/all-in-one LocalVault |

### Heartbeat

Child nodes send a heartbeat to the parent every 5 minutes by default (adjustable via `VEILKEY_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`).
The parent tracks each node's status (online/offline) in the children list.
A heartbeat must include at minimum:

- `vault_hash`
- `vault_name`
- `key_version`

KeyCenter maintains inventory based on these values and rejects a LocalVault whose version does not match.

Heartbeats also carry `managed_paths` metadata and manage rebind state:

- **`managed_paths`**
  - List of actual service paths the LocalVault is responsible for
  - Duplicate / overlap is allowed
  - Actual owner identification is based on `vault_node_uuid` (compatibility alias: `node_id`) / `vault_hash`
- **Tracked ref sync**
  - When a LocalVault performs a `TEMP -> LOCAL/EXTERNAL` promotion or other lifecycle change, the KeyCenter tracked ref is updated accordingly
  - Sync requests locate the current `vault_runtime_hash` owner by `vault_node_uuid`
  - This path must be alive for direct `VK:LOCAL:*` resolve to work without returning `404`
- **`key_version_mismatch` escalation**
  - First mismatch: `rebind_required`
  - Subsequent retries: `1min -> 3min -> 10min -> blocked`
  - However, if the LocalVault later sends a heartbeat with the correct `key_version`, temporary `rebind_required` / `blocked(key_version_mismatch)` states are automatically cleared
- **Planned rotation timeout**
  - If `rotation_required` is not resolved by the next heartbeat/tick, it escalates through `1min -> 3min -> 10min` stages
  - This escalation proceeds not only from `rotate-all` but also during regular inventory queries (`/api/agents`) and heartbeat boundaries
  - If never resolved: `blocked` + `block_reason=rotation_timeout`
  - A LocalVault blocked this way is auto-excluded from the next `POST /api/agents/rotate-all` target set
- **`blocked` state**
  - All resolve/save/get/config/migrate routes are blocked
  - The old identity cannot reopen normal routes until a human-approved rebind is performed

### Human-Approved Rebind

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST /api/agents/{agent}/approve-rebind` | | Approve rebind; issues a new `vault_hash` and incremented `key_version` |

After rebind approval, the LocalVault must update its local `node_info.version` with the new `key_version` and send another heartbeat.

### Operations

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST /api/unlock` | `{"password":"..."}` | Unlock a locked server |
| `POST /api/heartbeat` | `{"vault_node_uuid":"...","vault_hash":"...","vault_name":"...","key_version":1}` | Child-to-parent heartbeat (automatic; `node_id` alias accepted) |
| `GET /api/health` | | Health check |
| `GET /api/status` | | HKM status info (includes `tracked_refs_count`) |
| `POST /api/rekey` | `{"dek":"..."}` | Re-encrypt everything with a new DEK issued by the parent |
| `POST /api/set-parent` | `{"parent_url":"..."}` | Change parent URL |

### Tracked Ref Audit

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/tracked-refs/audit` | | Aggregate `blocked`/`stale` status and reasons for tracked refs |

Tracked ref audit maintains only two top-level classes:

- **`blocked`**
  - Refs requiring immediate use-blocking or quarantine
- **`stale`**
  - Refs requiring central cleanup or ownership recovery

Current `stale.reason` values:

- `missing_owner` -- the tracked ref row itself has an empty owner vault hash
- `missing_agent` -- owner vault hash exists but is not present in the current inventory
- `duplicate_ref_id` -- more than one ref exists for the same `vault_hash + family + id` combination
- `agent_mismatch` -- the same `family + id` spans more than one vault hash

New top-level classes are added only when the required operational action genuinely differs. Until then, extend `blocked` or `stale.reason` instead.

## LXC Deploy

`scripts/deploy-lxc.sh` operates in the following sequence:

1. Builds a new binary locally.
2. Reads the target LXC's systemd unit path via `vibe_lxc_ops`.
3. Pushes the binary to the LXC and restarts the service.
4. Reads back the deployed binary's SHA256 from inside the LXC and verifies it matches the local build artifact.

The deploy is not considered successful if this verification fails.
This script must be run on a Proxmox host, and the CI deploy job must run on a `proxmox-host` runner.

## Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

- `tests/integration/removed_endpoints_test.go`
  - Verifies that KeyCenter does not serve local `/api/secrets*` or federation secret routes
- `internal/api/hkm_agent_secret_routes_test.go`
  - Verifies that direct `/api/secrets*` is empty and the only supported plaintext ingress is the `/api/agents/{agent}/secrets` route
- `internal/api/hkm_resolve_no_local_secret_test.go`
  - Verifies that `GET /api/resolve/VK:LOCAL:{ref}` returns `404` without local secret fallback, even when rows exist in the `secrets` table
- `internal/api/hkm_agent_secrets_test.go`
  - Verifies that LocalVault secret public responses use only scoped canonical tokens (`VK:{SCOPE}:{REF}`) and do not expose the legacy `VK:{ref}` format

## Identity Migration Checkpoint

- canonical operator-facing/runtime fields: `vault_node_uuid`, `vault_runtime_hash`
- compatibility aliases: `node_id`, `agent_hash`
- current DB columns and route surface still keep legacy names for compatibility and staged migration safety

## MR Rule

- runtime, deploy, install, CLI, API behavior changes must add focused regression tests in the same MR
- user-facing or operator-facing behavior changes must update README/docs in the same MR
- the repo CI runs `tests/test_mr_guard.sh` and `scripts/check-mr-guard.sh` to block weak MRs
